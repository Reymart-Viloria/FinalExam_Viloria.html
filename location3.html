          <h1>ADVENTURE</h1>
       <center> <p>Thanks to the chilly climate and the abundance of majestic pine trees, Baguio is known as the City of Pines and the Summer Capital of the country. Indeed, Baguio's cool weather is enough reason to jump on a bus and head up north. But beyond its weather and countryside charm, Baguio is also a bustling metropolis with a rich history, diverse culture, and vibrant art scene

            <dd>When I think of the City of Pines, what comes to mind is an image of, well, pine trees. Pine trees rising from red needle-covered slopes. Pine trees that sometimes hide behind sheets of fog in the early morning. Pine trees first, way before a picture of a mall standing atop a hill or blocks of apartment buildings dominating the landscape. Development is unrelenting. It seems that each step it takes toward a more commercialized future turns its rustic atmosphere into a thing of the past.</dd>
